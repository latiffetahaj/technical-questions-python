    20. Valid Parentheses
    Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

    An input string is valid if:
        Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
        Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
        Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

    Constraints:
        1 <= s.length <= 10^4
        s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.
