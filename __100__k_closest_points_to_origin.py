    973. K Closest Points to Origin
    Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

    The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2).

    You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).


    Constraints:
        1 <= k <= points.length <= 10^4
        -10^4 <= xi, yi <= 10^4
