'''
    190. Reverse Bits
    Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.


    Constraints:
        The input must be a binary string of length 32

'''
# For testing purposes the function:
# Returns the string binary representation, with trailing zeros stripped.
# Also the input is given as a binary.
