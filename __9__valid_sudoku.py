    36. Valid Sudoku

    Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

    Rules:
    Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
    Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
    Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
    Note:

    A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
    Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
