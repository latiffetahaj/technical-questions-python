    11. Container With Most Water
    You are given an integer array height of length n.
    There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
    Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

    Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

    Notice that you may not slant the container.

    Constraints:
        n == height.length
        2 <= n <= 10^5
        0 <= height[i] <= 10^4
