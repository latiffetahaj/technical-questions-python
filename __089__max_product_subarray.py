    152. Maximum Product Subarray
    Given an integer array nums, find a subarray that has the largest product, and return the product.

    The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

    Constraints:
        1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4
        -10 <= nums[i] <= 10
        The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
