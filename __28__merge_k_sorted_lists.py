    23. Merge k Sorted Lists
    You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.
    Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.


    Input is a list with heads of each list that is going to be merged
    Example:
        Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
        Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
        Explanation: The linked-lists are:
        [
        1->4->5,
        1->3->4,
        2->6
        ]
        merging them into one sorted list:
        1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6

    Constraints:
        k == lists.length
        0 <= k <= 10^4
        0 <= lists[i].length <= 500
        -10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4
        lists[i] is sorted in ascending order.
        The sum of lists[i].length will not exceed 10^4.

    #LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/description/

    Time Complexity: O(n logk), where n = lists[i].length, and k = lists.length

    Space Complexity: O(1)

        return None
